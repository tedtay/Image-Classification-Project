###  **Introduction**
Image recognition has a vast array of applications: facial recognition, google lens and image organisation are just a few of the possibilities. The technology driving image recognition is improving rapidly as the technology begins to become more prevalent in our daily lives. 
There are various approaches that can be taken when implementing image recognition, there are unsupervised methods such as K-Means and Gaussian clustering, supervised methods like Regression, Support Vector Machines and Neural Networks as well as dimensionality reduction to gain deeper insight into the structure of the data.
